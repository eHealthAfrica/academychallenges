        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"></p>
        <script>
             var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
            ohnoesSays.innerHTML = " Because of thses corona virus <em> covid </em> 19.";
            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
            winstonSays.textContent= " Hmmm, I hate to Say about thses virus, but these is not a joke.";
        </script>
