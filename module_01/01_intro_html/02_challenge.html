        Nobody’s born <em>smart</em>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the <strong>rest of us</strong>.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <em>born</em> to <em>learn</em>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        <strong>It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em></strong>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.</strong>
